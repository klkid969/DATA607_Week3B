# Week 3B: Window Functions — Moving Averages

## Overview
This project is part of DATA 607 coursework. It demonstrates how to:
- Retrieve financial stock price data using the `tidyquant` package.
- Calculate **Year-to-Date (YTD) cumulative averages** and **rolling 6-day moving averages**.
- Visualize stock price trends using `ggplot2`.

The analysis uses two sample stock symbols: **AAPL** (Apple) and **MSFT** (Microsoft).  
The final output includes a comparison of daily close prices versus the 6-day moving average to identify short-term trends.
